This is an automatic Amharic sexually explicit comment detection model by fine-tuning the BERT model, which was trained to detect hate speech in Amharic. We choose this model due to the closeness of hate speech with explicit content, and we do not find any model that is closer to it than this. The file also shows the comparison of the result with other state-of-the-art models like base BERT, CNN, SVM, and MLP.
